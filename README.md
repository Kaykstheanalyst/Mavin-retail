## Recommendation from findings
- The best performing product chart shows that street footwear has been consistently generating a high sales followed by apparels category. I'll recommend that Mavin brand increase the production and supply of the street footwears as this will boost sales.
- The sales trend shows that the sales recorded in 2020 was really low, probably due to the covid 19 pandemic but the sales trend in 2021 shows that there is a notble increase in the sales recorded. The month of October needed to be studied on how there has been a consistent decline in sales
- The retail sales performance chart shows that in 2020, West Gear retail store recorded the highest sales followed by Foot Locker reetail store. However, in 2021, Sport direct which was at fourth position from West Gear in 2020 topped the chart while West Gear was relegated to the third position. Mavin brand should check on West Gear in order to know the reason for such decline in sales and offer help in whichever way and also the Foot Locker retail store should also be commended for being consistent with their sales record.
- Sales by gender analysis also reveals that Men patronize the Mavin brand alongside using the product more than the women, However, the margin is versy slim which shows that the products are user friendly and widely accepted by both male and female, I'll recommend that products for children should also be included
- The effective sales method and the total unit sold shows that effect of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, but the 2021 year reaveals that there was such an explosive increase in the number of customers using the online platform which really contributes to the improvement in sales. I will recommend that more campaigns should be done in order to emcourage customers to use the online store, and also ensure that the website is customer friendly in order to enhance a seamless usage of the platform.
